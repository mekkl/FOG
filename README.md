# The Task
Using Scrum as the process model, you must develop major parts of a multi-user database application.

The constraints on your work can be summarized in a set of requirements regarding:
1. what you have to develop
2. how do you have to work
3. what you must hand in or demonstrate

# Product requirements
You must develop and (partly) test a system that meets (parts of) the needs of the customer.

Note that the requirements may be subject to changes and “clarifications” during the project period.

The solution respects the following set of technical and design related constraints:
1. It must use a MySQL 5.7 database.
2. The design must reflect a logical multilayer architecture running on a Java server (Tomcat).
3. Your application must use both plain java classes, servlets and JSP’s.
4. The web page must be usable in either Chrome or Firefox.
5. The developed application must be deployed in the cloud (e.g. digital ocean).

# Process requirements – in short
The project covers a number of Scrum sprints. Planning these sprints must be done according to the guidelines in Scrum. You are the Scrum Team and the teachers will act as Product Owner, but you will be responsible for identifying and writing the stories. Note that days are set aside in the end of the project period to finish the report.

At the end of each sprint, a sprint review will be held where you must prepare a demo of the stories implemented by the group during the sprint. Also, there will be a technical review of your implementation.
